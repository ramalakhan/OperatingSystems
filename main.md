## 📖 Introduction
Welcome to my Operating System portfolio. This journal documents the complete journey of deploying, configuring, and hardening a Linux-based server environment. Over the course of seven weeks, I have transformed a bare-metal virtual machine into a secure, performance-optimised web server, documenting every command, configuration, and challenge encountered along the way.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
Through this coursework, I have achieved the following key technical competencies:
* **System Deployment:** Proficient in setting up Virtual Machines and managing Linux file systems.
* **Security Administration:** Implemented strict access controls, SSH hardening, and Firewall (UFW) policies.
* **Performance Engineering:** Conducted stress testing (CPU, RAM, I/O) and resolved network bottlenecks.
* **Automation & Scripting:** Utilized Bash for automation and `cron` for scheduled system maintenance.
* **Auditing & Compliance:** Performed industry-standard security audits using **Lynis** and **Nmap**.
